BattleBoats

This is an application built with Java that my partner and I built in a university course. BattleBoats, like its name suggests, is a spin-off of the famous board game Battleship. In addition to the 1x1 attacks of a normal game, there are special moves that can strike the enemy's entire row or column, or even strike a 3x3 attack.

To compile and run, 
simply do

```
javac Game.java
java game
```
